There are some everyday heroes such as firefighters and policemen. However, some people in history greatly impacted how our world is today. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison&rsquo;s changes to the world of inventing influenced inventors old and new, and that&rsquo;s what makes them heroic.</span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin Franklin, a printer and inventor, shaped America in many ways during the American Revolution. </span><span class="c3">Benjamin Franklin, the inventor of bifocals, also did heroic things during the American Revolution. His face is even on the 100-dollar bill! He was also a Founding Father who signed the Declaration of Independence and the Treaty of Paris. Also, he proposed the idea of daylight savings. &ldquo;In 1776, Franklin had already accomplished many of the things he is best known for today, but would go on to sign not only the Declaration of Independence but also the Treaty of Paris, as well as the Constitution.&rdquo; (The Franklin Institute) This shows heroism by proving that he signed the three most important documents in the history of America. Also, without the Treaty of Paris, the country of America wouldn&rsquo;t even exist. Benjamin Franklin also made many iconic inventions. This inspired others to have a patriotic spirit towards America, therefore developing a sense of love from all American residents. &ldquo;&lsquo;Join, or Die,&rsquo; despite having once been a rallying cry for supporting the British, has become an enduring symbol of American unity.&rdquo; (The Franklin Institute) This proves inspiration because the quote says &ldquo;become an enduring symbol of American unity&rdquo; which shows how it has become a big part of America. Benjamin Franklin is called a hero because of his many inventions and his newspaper.</span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison was an inspirational and perseverant inventor. Thomas Alva Edison always tinkered with machines when he was a child. He got a job as a telegraph operator, which sparked his love for communications and inventions. When he was inventing the lightbulb, one of his most famous quotes was &ldquo;I have not failed. I&rsquo;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; (Fearless Motivation) This shows heroism by describing how his positive attitude led him to success. It also shows that failure is </span><span class="c8 c10">the</span><span>&nbsp;road to success. A final way it shows heroism is how many times he had to try just to get his inventions to work. Although Edison didn&rsquo;t necessarily </span><span class="c11">invent</span><span>&nbsp;the lightbulb, he helped bring it out of the darkness and into the spotlight by making it practical. This has inspired many other light-based inventions, like LEDs. &ldquo;Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.&rdquo; (thomasedison.org) This shows impact because it inspired other people to try and try again when inventing devices. Take Shuji Nakamura, for example. He was threatened by his boss but he </span><span class="c8">still</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;persevered to the end when he invented the blue LED. Thomas Alva Edison was an influential inventor and impacted the inventing world forever. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Alva Edison&rsquo;s innovative thinking changed the world forever. Benjamin Franklin was an important figure in the American Revolution. Thomas Alva Edison improved on the lightbulb and invented the phonograph. Both of these people were influential inventors that changed the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="t.d4958612a7b5b0b0571a3f64668b063e1ec15148"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c9"><tr class="c6"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Source</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Citation</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c6"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ducksters</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Biography.&rdquo; Ducksters, www.ducksters.com/biography/ben_franklin.php. </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c6"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ducksters</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Biography.&rdquo; Ducksters, www.ducksters.com/biography/thomas_edison.php. </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c6"><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ducksters</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ducksters. &quot;Thomas Edison Biography.&quot; Ducksters, Technological Solutions, Inc.
